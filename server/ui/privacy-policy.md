# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 17 February 2026

## 1. Who We Are

JoinCloud is a LAN-first file sharing and file management application for macOS and Windows.

The app is developed and operated by:

Shakyawar Mediatech LLP  
Under the jurisdiction of Uttar Pradesh, India  
Email: support@joincloud.in

This Privacy Policy explains how JoinCloud handles information when you use the application and related website.

JoinCloud is designed to run locally on your device. We do not operate a public cloud storage service.

## 2. Scope of This Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to:

• The JoinCloud desktop application (macOS and Windows)  
• The local web interface ("Cloud URL") accessible on your local network  
• The official JoinCloud website (if applicable)

It does not apply to third-party software, operating systems, or networks that you use alongside JoinCloud.

## 3. What Data We Collect

JoinCloud is designed with privacy as a core principle.

### We Do Not:

• Collect your personal files  
• Upload your files to our servers  
• Access your files remotely  
• Sell user data  
• Provide advertising  
• Collect payment information

### We May Store Locally on Your Device:

• App configuration settings  
• Device pairing approvals (approved devices on your LAN)  
• Share link metadata (such as creation time or expiration)  
• Local telemetry counters (see Section 5)  
• Local log files (see Section 6)

All of the above data remains on your device.

We do not have access to your files or your local data.

## 4. Local Network Access and Admin Approvals

JoinCloud works within your local area network (LAN).

When you launch the app:

• It generates a local Cloud URL  
• Devices connected to the same network can request access  
• Access requires explicit admin approval (pairing)

This means:

• No device can access your files without your approval  
• You can revoke device access at any time  
• JoinCloud does not automatically expose your files to the internet

You are responsible for securing your local network.

## 5. Telemetry (Local Only Usage Counters)

JoinCloud may record lightweight usage counters locally on your device, such as:

• Number of uploads  
• Number of downloads  
• Number of shares created  
• Basic feature usage counts

These counters:

• Do not contain personal data  
• Do not contain file names or file content  
• Are stored locally  
• Are not transmitted to us

A telemetry disable option is available in Settings. You can turn it off at any time.

## 6. Log Files

JoinCloud may create local log files to help diagnose issues and maintain performance.

Logs may include:

• Device connection events  
• Pairing approvals or rejections  
• Errors and crash details  
• File transfer status (not file content)

Log files:

• Are stored locally on your device  
• Are not automatically sent to us  
• May contain technical information such as IP addresses within your local network

You may delete log files at any time by removing the app data from your device.

## 7. Sharing Links

JoinCloud allows you to create share links within your local network.

Sharing links:

• Work only within your LAN environment  
• Can be revoked at any time  
• May support expiration (if enabled)  
• Require admin control and visibility

You remain fully in control of all shared content. JoinCloud does not store or manage these links outside your device.

## 8. Data Storage Location

All JoinCloud data is stored locally on your device.

This includes:

• Files you manage  
• Configuration settings  
• Pairing records  
• Telemetry counters  
• Log files

We do not operate remote storage servers for user files.

## 9. Data Retention

Because all data is stored locally:

• Data remains on your device until you delete it  
• Uninstalling JoinCloud may remove associated local app data depending on your operating system  
• You can manually delete app data, logs, and shared files at any time

We do not retain copies of your data.

## 10. Security

JoinCloud is designed with the following principles:

• LAN-only architecture with no public cloud dependency  
• Admin approval required for device pairing  
• Manual share revocation  
• User-controlled start and stop sharing

However:

• Security also depends on your local network configuration  
• If your LAN is exposed to the internet, your access controls may be affected  
• You are responsible for maintaining network security

We implement reasonable technical safeguards consistent with applicable laws.

## 11. Children's Privacy

JoinCloud is not directed toward children.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since we do not collect personal data, there is no intentional collection of children's information.

## 12. International Users

JoinCloud is operated by Shakyawar Mediatech LLP under the jurisdiction of Uttar Pradesh, India.

By using the application, you understand that the software operates locally on your device and does not transfer personal data to our servers.

We comply with applicable data protection laws relevant to our operations.

## 13. Your Choices and Controls

You are always in control of your data.

You can:

• Stop file sharing at any time  
• Revoke device access  
• Revoke individual share links  
• Revoke all share links  
• Disable telemetry in Settings  
• Delete local logs  
• Uninstall the app and remove all local data

Because we do not have access to your files or data, we cannot access, modify, or delete your content.

## 14. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.

If we make changes:

• We will update the Effective Date  
• Updated versions may be posted on our website and or inside the app

Continued use of JoinCloud after updates means you accept the revised policy.
