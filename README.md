JoinCloud
A Personal Cloud Network

JoinCloud allows you to create a local cloud on your system and share files directly with other users using a simple link.

Only the sender needs to install JoinCloud.
Receivers can access shared files through a browser without installing anything.

Fast. Secure. In your control.

What is JoinCloud?

JoinCloud turns your system into a personal cloud node.

Instead of uploading files to third-party cloud services, JoinCloud lets you share files directly from your machine. Files are served from your system and accessed via a generated link.

This gives you:

Full control over your files

Faster transfers on local networks

No dependency on cloud storage accounts

No mandatory installation for receivers

Core Benefits

Fast
Files are transferred directly without cloud uploads.

Secure
Files remain on your system and are shared only when you allow it.

Full Control
You decide what to share, when to share, and when to stop sharing.
